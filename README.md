# Interview Scheduler

This is a project based on the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. It's my first time using React, StoryBook, Jest, Cypress.
The CSS was given to me, I really liked the way React and Cypress works. The project works fine, there is some improvement possible,
I will try to update it with some stretch work but this is not a guarantied.
